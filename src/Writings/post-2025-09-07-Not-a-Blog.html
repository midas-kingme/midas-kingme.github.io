    <p>I haven't posted a blog, let alone anything on the Internet in forever and I'm going to start again. But first
      had to get past writer's block and the fear of being judged. So this is my test. But because you clicked on
      this fucker, I'll write a little something for you.
    </p>

    <p>Writing used to come quite natural for me when I was in grade school. Somewhere between freshman and sophomore
      year of college is when that kinda fell off. I stopped reading for fun I think was the problem. When I younger, I
      practically lived in Barnes & Noble. From comics to classical literature, I would read anything and everything.
      You literally couldn't keep a book out my hands.</p>

    <p>Once transferring from community college to university, I stopped becoming interested in education and more into
      girls and partying. I would witness how guys who weren't that smart seemingly had a easy time with the ladies so I
      figured I'd follow suit.</p>

    <p>Doing so (or rather attempting to do so) was pretty stupid on my behalf considering that girls can sense when
      you're faking something [ ... ]</p>

    <p>Here’s an example of a blockquote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Technology should be a tool that amplifies our humanity, not distracts from it."
    </blockquote>

    <p>You can also use bullet points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First key idea</li>
      <li>Second key idea</li>
      <li>Third key idea</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And that’s it. Keep writing until you’re done ✍️</p>
