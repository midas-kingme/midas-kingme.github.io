    <p>I haven't posted a blog, let alone anything on the Internet in forever and I'm going to start again. But first
      had to get past writer's block and the fear of being judged. So this is my test. But because you clicked on
      this fucker, I'll write a little something for you.
    </p>

    <p>Writing used to come quite natural for me when I was in grade school. Somewhere between freshman and sophomore
      year of college is when that kinda fell off. I stopped reading for fun I think was the problem. When I younger, I
      practically lived in Barnes & Noble. From comics to classical literature, I would read anything and everything.
      You literally couldn't keep a book out my hands.</p>

    <p>Then came college. Somewhere between freshman and sophomore, that all stopped. I stopped reading for fun. I
      stopped caring about learning. Of course something had to fill that void right? That's when partying, boozing, and
      girls became the center of my attention. I was also still super fuckin insecure, so what I'd do is study dudes who
      seemed cool and appeared to have dating down-pact. Or so it'd appeared.</p>

    <p>Watching guys who weren't that bright get the ladies effortlessly, I thought I'd try the same..</p>

    <p><strong>Spoiler:</strong></p>

      from a mile away."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Looking back, it wasn't just about girls. I was avoiding thinking for myself. Avoiding growth and discipline. I'm
      gonna try this whole writing thing.. Not to impress anyone, but to vent mostly.</p>

    <p>So yeah, if you're reading this, then my post was a success. This isn't a blog. Just a playground for chaos.</p>
