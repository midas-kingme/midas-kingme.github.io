        <h1>Rhetoric and Responsibility</h1>

        <p>So Charlie Kirk was just assassinated as of today, Wednesday, September 10, 2025. <strong>Yeah</strong>, that
            happened..<em>live</em> in front of hundreds if not thousands of people.
        </p>

        <p>At the time, he's been heavily involved in his "American Comeback Tour" and hosting "Prove Me Wrong" debate
            setups. I'm still very much in shock by what happened..And even more shocked by the online response, the
            backlash as well as the support. </p>

        <p>Truly, what boggled my mind is the amount of support from people that I know. People who's values I'd
            assume were not totally aligned with Kirk's. I'm in no way demonising supporting a man - a father and
            husband, and a now widow who's just lost everything. But at some point, we have to examine what may have led
            up to this. </p>

        <p>Charlie Kirk‚Äôs life and death show how powerful and how polarizing rhetoric can be in shaping our culture.
        </p>

        <p>Whatever you thought of him, there‚Äôs no denying he left a mark on American conservatism. Besides Ben Shapiro,
            his style of debating was definitely interesting to watch to say the least. He became a voice for many young
            conservatives who felt unheard in mainstream spaces.</p>

        <p>
            At the same time, his rhetoric was often deeply divisive. He framed politics in ‚Äúus vs. them‚Äù terms, spread
            controversial claims about elections, COVID, and climate change, and made arguments like saying gun deaths
            were a ‚Äúprudent deal‚Äù and ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù to preserve the Second Amendment. For supporters, he was simply
            expressing his convictions. For critics, his words insinuated divisiveness and mistrust.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Is it wrong to feel conflicted at a moment like this? Is it strange to feel empathy or very little at all?
        </blockquote>

        <p>We can acknowledge the tragedy of his death and the wrongness of political violence, while also being honest
            about the kind of discourse he advocated for‚Ä¶discourse that often prioritized confrontation over
            understanding.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm absolutely saddened and heartbroken for his wife, son, and daughter and pray they are able to find
            peace..Political violence is never justified. If I‚Äôve learned anything today, it‚Äôs that the way we use our
            words matters.</p>
