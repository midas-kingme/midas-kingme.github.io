        <p>College has honestly sucked from the moment I got here. Granted, I could have been more prepared, mentally,
            financially, etc..</p>

        <p>They'll tell you there scholarships, there's financial aid, there's ways to get by. That's bullshit! lol </p>

        <p>So I graduated from high school back in Summer 2013. Sylacauga High School in Sylacauga, Alabama. Damn that's
            wild.
            Anywho, I immediately started classes at Central Alabama Community College that following summer. I was
            granted a <em>show choir</em> scholarship where as long as I
            participated in several of the hosted showcases, I was given a full ride
            to take classes.</p>

        <p>As ashamed as I am to admit, I was never that into sports. I mean I played baseball a good bit throughout
            youth. I was heavily into theatre, and reading, and computers. I was what you would call a
            <em>"Disney kid"</em>. Fuckin embarrassing lol. So, I'm just now starting out as a freshman and was
            basically given the hookup. You mean to tell me every single one of my courses are paid for, I still get a
            grant from FAFSA in case I need textbooks, and all I gotta do is attend class and sing?
            Shiiid..Why not?

        <p>Fuggit. I'm about to get my Zac Efron on. I had participated in some shows early on in teenagehood so I had
            little to no nervous jitters. Plus I saw it as an opportunity to act a fool in front of the crowd.</p>

        <p>And that‚Äôs it. Keep writing until you‚Äôre done > ‚úçüèæ</p>
