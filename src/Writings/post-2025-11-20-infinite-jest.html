        <p>Okay. Get your bootstraps ready, this is gonna be a dark one.</p>

        <p>Ready? Let's begin.</p>

        <p>As of late, I've been heavily fascinated with the concept of Death and suicidal ideation.</p>

        <p>Look at me trying to sound all deep and ominous.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Quick sidenote but you probably peeped that the title of this post is the same as the 1996 novel "Infinite
            Jest" authored by the late David Foster
            Wallace. Wallace attempts to engage the reader by exploring various forms of entertainment, causes and
            symptoms of addiction, as well as the human condition; in a way
            that's supposed to be considered satirical in nature, though the deeper you dive, the more you begin to
            notice how
            entertainment and addiction exacerbates depression in the average individual. It's no secret that David
            Foster Wallace was incredibly depressed yet oh so sensitive. The novel <strong>is</strong> a literal
            reflection of the world as Wallace sees it, compiled from the depths of the mind of a highly depressed and
            deeply troubled
            individual.

        <p>But seriously, the absense of Life is truly fascinating. The fact that each and every living thing has a
            TimeClock; that your time on this planet is bound to end at some unknown point in the future.</p>

        <p>Some people on the other hand have unfortunately tried to take matters into their own hands by lessening the
            TimeClock;
            although it wasn't at all their time.</p>

        <p>Yeah..talking about suicide here folks.</p>

        <blockquote>Do you know how selfish of a cunt someone has to be to actually go through with it?</blockquote>

        <p>Or at least, that's how I used to see it.</p>

        <p>I used to think that committing suicide makes a person weak. That's actually bullshit. On the contrary, I'd
            say it makes someone rather strong. Not strong in a positive sense, but you
            gotta admit ~ there is in fact a boldness associated with the act.</p>

        <p>Think about it. Some people are bold enough to skydive, others are willing to take a deep dive
            into the Marianna Trench. But to come to the conclusion that you're ready to stop living?</p>

        <p>Man..
        <p>

        <p>After intentionally taking the time to examine my own depression, I've recently become more aware to what
            drives a person to this point.</p>

        <p>People with suicide ideation do not wish to die. They don't at all want to bring emotional pain to their
            loved ones. They've simply come to the conclusion that Life isn't at all as colourful as they may have once
            perceived.</p>

        <p>I was talking to my therapist the other day and he mentioned that "people every now and again deserve a win
            and it's the little
            wins that keep you going". <strong>That's when it hit me.</strong> Suicidal folks have not had a win in a
            long <strong>long</strong> time.</p>

        <p>Like yeah, from the outside, someone may look successful, happy, easy-going; but in their mind, they have not
            had the win that they so desperately desire.</p>

        <p>People like David Foster Wallace and even Kurt Cobain were highly sensitive individuals ~ in a way that's
            totally relatable. Their ideas and opinions overlapped and would often express their disdain for:
            homelessness, the fact that war <strong><em>still</em></strong> exists, poverty, and exploitation; the list
            goes on.</p>

        <p>Their concern was linked to the question of "Why the world <em>is</em> the way that it is and what can be
            done about it?"</p>

        <p>I don't believe humans would thrive in a utopia. Humans are wired to struggle. Struggle is how great works of
            art
            are composed. Struggle is the match that lights the fire in the heart of the individual. However for the
            individual whose deepest desires aren't met, <strong>nothing</strong> is able to ignite that fire; let alone
            maintain a lit
            flame. </p>

        <p>And yet, that's what makes Wallace and Cobain's circumstance so interesting. From an objective point-of-view,
            they seem to have it all. Fame, money, hit songs, you name it! And yet none of that mattered to them.</p>

        <blockquote>What's the point in gaining the world if others are still suffering?</blockquote>

        <p>I've never believed suicide to be the answer and although I am now more aware of what could cause a person to
            go through with it, that sentiment remains the same.</p>

        <p>This post is still being edited for grammatical purposes... </p>
